Limelight tracks targets at 90 frames-per-second. Information is posted to network tables, so we support every programming language.
Get tracking in one session with three cables, four screws, and a small amount of code in any language.
Configure your vision pipelines with a simple web interface. 
Mount your Limelight with the built-in mounting holes.
Run two wires to your PDP, and run an ethernet cable to your radio
Give your Limelight a team number, an IP address, and add a few lines of robot code.
Your robot now has targeting information streaming-in at 90 frames-per-second.
